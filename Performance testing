We shall perform the following test on glusterfs:
1)Initial write and re-write
2)Read and re-read
3)Random read and random write

Distributed testing is a strength of the iozone utility, but this requires use of "-+m" option.
The configuration file passed with "-+m" option contains a series of records that look like this:
    hostname   directory   iozone-pathname

Where hostname is a host name or IP address of a test driver machine that iozone can use.
Directory is the pathname of a directory to use within that host.
Iozone-pathname is the full pathname of the iozone executable to use on that host.
Be sure that every target host can resolve the hostname of host where the iozone command was run.

The command used is:
    /opt/iozone/bin/iozone -r 128k -i 0 -i 1 -i 2 -t 4 -s 1G -+m client.cnf -b iozone_test.xls

In the above command:
-r: Specifies the record size in kB.
-i: Used to specify which tests to run. (0=write/rewrite, 1=read/re-read, 2=random-read/write).
-t: Run in throughput mode. Allows the user to specify how many threads or processes to have active during the measurement.
-s: Specifies the file of the size to test.
-+m:  Use multiple buffers.
-b: Used to specify a filename that will be used for output of an Excel compatible file that contains the results.

We run the command multiple times to check the impact of changes in file size, record size and the number of threads.

The following file sizes are used: 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB.
The following record sizes are used: 128 kB, 256 kB, 512 kB.
The number of threads used are: 1, 2, 4.
