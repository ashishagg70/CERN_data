A couple of things have to be done before using IOzone for distributed file systems.

1) All the client machines should be connected through a passwordless ssh connection.

2) IOzone uses rsh by default. So rsh needs to be changed to ssh.
   This can be done by the following command.
      export RSH=ssh
