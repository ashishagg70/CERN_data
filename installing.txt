1.First of all we installed ubuntu 14.04 on the 4 computers or nodes.(
here computer specifications are 760MB RAM and 128 GB hard disk.)

2.Then we install GlusterFs on the computers.here are the steps:-

1) Install python-software-properties.

	
	sudo apt-get install python-software-properties


2) Add the GlusterFS PPA.


	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gluster/glusterfs-3.5

	sudo apt-get update


3) Install glusterfs-server.


	sudo apt-get install glusterfs-server


4) Go to the first server and run the following command:


	sudo gluster peer probe <ipaddress-2>

	sudo gluster peer probe <ipaddress-3>

This command will form a cluster. To know the status of the cluster, execute the following:


	sudo gluster peer status

The output should show that this server is connected to 2 peers.

5) Now execute the same command from the second or third server.


	sudo gluster peer status
You will again see that there are 2 peers but instead of the hostname of the first server, it has registered its IP address. To fix this, run the following command from second or third server:
	

sudo gluster peer probe <hostname-1>

Now on executing sudo gluster peer status, you will see hostname of the first server and not its IP address.
