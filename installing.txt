1.First of all we installed fedora 22 on the 4 computers or nodes.(
here computer specifications are 760MB RAM and 128 GB hard disk.)

2.Then we install GlusterFs on the computers.here are the steps:-

1) Install glusterfs-server.


	sudo apt-get install glusterfs-server


2) Go to the first server and run the following command:


	sudo gluster peer probe <ipaddress-2>

	sudo gluster peer probe <ipaddress-3>

This command will form a cluster. To know the status of the cluster, execute the following:


	sudo gluster peer status

The output should show that this server is connected to 2 peers.

3) Now execute the same command from the second or third server.


	sudo gluster peer status
