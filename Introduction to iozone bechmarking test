Performance testing for glusterfs is being done through IOzone benchmarking tool.

The benchmark generates and measures a variety of file operations.
Iozone has been ported to many machines and runs under many operating systems.
Iozone is useful for determining a broad filesystem analysis of a vendorâ€™s computer platform.
The benchmark tests file I/O performance for the following operations:
  Read, write, re-read, re-write, read backwards, read strided, fread, fwrite, random read/write,
  pread/pwrite variants, aio_read, aio_write, mmap.
  
Definitions of the tests:
1)Write:  This test measures the performance of writing a new file.

2)Re-write: This test measures the performance of writing a file that already exists.

3)Read: This test measures the performance of reading an existing file. 

4)Re-Read: This test measures the performance of reading a file that was recently read.

5)Random Read: This test measures the performance of reading a file with accesses being made to random locations within the file.

6)Random Write: This test measures the performance of writing a file with accesses being made to random locations within the file.

7)Random Mix: This test measures the performance of reading and writing a file with accesses being made to random locations within the file.

8)Backwards Read: This test measures the performance of reading a file backwards.

9)Record Rewrite: This test measures the performance of writing and re-writing a particular spot within a file.

10)Strided Read:  This test measures the performance of reading a file with a strided access behavior.

11)Fwrite: This test measures the performance of writing a file using the library function fwrite().

12)Frewrite: This test measures the performance of writing a file using the library function fwrite().

13)Fread: This test measures the performance of reading a file using the library function fread().

14)Freread: This test is the same as fread above except that in this test the file that is being read was read in the recent past.
