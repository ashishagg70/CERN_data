To access all the servers by names other than their ip addresses do the following:

Open the hosts file under root privileges:
    sudo nano /etc/hosts
You should see something that looks like this:

    127.0.0.1       localhost gluster2

    # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    ::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    fe00::0 ip6-localnet
    ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

Below the local host definition, you should add each VPS's IP address followed by the long and short names you wish to use to reference it.

It should look something like this when you are finished:

    127.0.0.1       localhost hostname
    first_ip gluster0.droplet.com gluster0
    second_ip gluster1.droplet.com gluster1
    third_ip gluster2.droplet.com gluster2
    
    # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    ::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    fe00::0 ip6-localnet
    ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

The gluster0.droplet.com and gluster0 portions of the lines can be changed to whatever name you would like to use to access each droplet.

This should be done on all machines.


To create a storage volume do the following:

    sudo gluster volume create volume_name replica num_of_servers transport tcp domain1.com:/path/to/data/directory domain2.com:/path/to/data/directory ... force

This command will create a volume. It will store the data from this volume in directories on each host. If a directory does not exist it will be created.
At this point, our volume is created, but inactive. We can start the volume and make it available for use by typing:

    sudo gluster volume start volume1


To install and configure the client components do the following:

On your client machine type:
    sudo apt-get install glusterfs-client

We are going to mount our remote storage volume on our client computer. To do that create a directory in the /mnt directory:
    sudo mkdir /mnt/storage_pool

To mount the remote volume:
    sudo mount -t glusterfs domain1.com:volume_name path_to_mount_point

On the client machine if we add file in the storage_pool, the files will also be shown on the servers in the gluster directory.

To get information about the gluster volume:
    sudo gluster volume info


To add a brick to an existing volume:

On the first server in the cluster, probe the server to which you want to add the new brick using the following command:
    sudo gluster peer probe HOSTNAME

Run the following command
    sudo gluster volume add-brick <volume> replica n <server ip or hostname>:<absolute path to where the brick data should be stored>
Here n is the number of copies of the file that you want to create.

To remove a brick use the following command:
    sudo gluster volume remove-brick <volume> replica n <server ip or hostname>:< absolute path to where the brick data was stored.>
